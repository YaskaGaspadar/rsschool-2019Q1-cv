1. I want to become a full stack JS programmer(consider React as framework for front-end), because I see a great potential it this language(and ecosystem as well) and really enjoy the way it's been developing. I tried a lot of technologies before, starting with C and ending with Solidity, and eventually haven't found anything better then JS. So now my aim is to become at least Senior JS Developer.
